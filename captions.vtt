Hey, welcome! This video is all about getting your HTML captions set up properly.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In the next few moments, you’ll see how easy it is to add subtitles to your projects.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Captions help make your content accessible and way more professional.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can use .vtt files to sync text with your video timeline.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Each caption has a start time, an end time, and the text you want displayed.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Make sure your timestamps are clean and in the correct format.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
After that, just link the file in your <track> element in HTML.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Once the browser loads it, boom — captions appear automatically.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Remember, accessibility isn’t optional. It’s part of good web design.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Keep experimenting and tweaking your caption timing for smooth reading.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You're now ready to add captions to any video on your site.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Thanks for watching — go build something fire.
